Note: Certain outputs, while being correct, are not in the order given in the sample outputs. For example, neighbors 
and connected components might be in different orders while being correct, and the shortest path may be different
if there are multiple shortest paths with equal lengths. Also, since we were instructed to do so, the listNeighbors 
function prints the path to each neighbor with the given distance. Finally, this code assumes that the end of line 
character is "\n" and the provided input files are used.
